The Neo Human Interface Submarine is a state of the art vessel capable of adapting to hostile environments by subsuming local resources for the purpose of self modification. It's also finally done! I couldn't resist taking it for a quick little dive. I'm sure my colleague will understand. Now let's get to catalouging what sorts of materials are available to me down heere.

By subsuming local minerals and wildlife I've managed to improve the Neo Human Interface Submarine's hull while also refilling the fuel reserves with some fish and plant based biofuel. Analysis of upgraded hull integrity signifies a new maximum safe depth. How could I resist going just a little bit deeper? My research partner won't mind as long as I'm back in the morning.

This new technology is amazing! Before today a solo exploration mission would require so much arduous planning, but now such undertakings can happen on a whim. If I go any deeper my colleague might need some explaining about where I've been, but surely they will understand if I bring back data on some big new discovery. Just a little bit further down and surely there will be something new for me to find.

With materials gathered down here I've manage to further reinforce my hull to allow futher diving. There is a certain closeness I now feel with the New Human Interface Submarine. At times it's easy to forget where my body ends and the vessel begins. After I return to the surface in a couple of days with an new discovery my partner in science will forgive me for venturing down here alone. I'm sure they're worried sick by now.
