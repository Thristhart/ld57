The Neo Human Interface Submarine is a state of the art vessel capable of adapting to hostile environments by subsuming local resources for the purpose of self modification. It's also finally done! I couldn't resist taking it for a quick little dive. I'm sure my colleague will understand. Now let's get to catalouging what sorts of materials are available to me down heere.

By subsuming local minerals and wildlife I've managed to improve the Neo Human Interface Submarine's hull while also refilling the fuel reserves with some fish and plant based biofuel. Analysis of upgraded hull integrity signifies a new maximum safe depth. How could I resist going just a little bit deeper? My research partner won't mind as long as I'm back in the morning.
